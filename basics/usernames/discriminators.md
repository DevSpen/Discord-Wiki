# Discriminators

### What Are Discriminators?

Discriminators are four digit numbers \(between 0001 and 9999\) that start with `#`, they come at the end of a user's username. A username and discriminator put together is called a tag. A user tag looks like this: `User#0000`, "User" being the username and `#0000` being the discriminator. Also note, only your profile shows your tag, generally only your display name \(username/nickname\) is shown when you are chatting in channels.

The purpose of discriminators is to allow multiple users have same username, yet be clearly identifiable. Users can not share the same tag, but users can share 1 of the 2 elements that make up a tag \(username or discriminator\).

Nitro / Nitro Classic users can change their discriminators. However when the subscription ends, the discriminator is changed back to its default randomized state _\(you will no longer have the custom discriminator\)_. In the next section, we will explain how to change your discriminator.
